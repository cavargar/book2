Also, let the cell cycle time $\\tau$ be the time it takes for a cell to grow and divide. The cell cycle progress is represented by the equation $$\\frac{d\\tau}{dt}=1, \\, \\tau(0)=0.$$\n\nA division event occurs when a cell splits into two daughter cells. This event resets both the cell size to half and the cell cycle time to zero, that is, $$ s \\mapsto s / 2, \\quad \\tau \\mapsto 0,$$ marking the end of one cycle and the start of a new one. Let $P(\\tau)$ define when division happens as per $$P(\\tau)=U(\\tau-\\bar{\\tau})=\\begin{cases}\n    1,  \\text{ if } \\tau > \\bar{\\tau} \\\\\n    0,  \\text{ otherwise,}\n\\end{cases}$$ where $U(\\tau-\\bar{\\tau})$ is the unit step function and $\\bar{\\tau}$ is the time to division since the start of the cell cycle. Cell performs a division event if $P(\\tau)=1$.\n\nThe division rate can be defined as $$\\begin{aligned}\n    p(\\tau)&=\\frac{d P}{d\\tau}\\\\\n    &=\\delta(\\tau-\\bar{\\tau}),\n\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\delta(\\tau)$ is the *Delta Dirac* function. The above description is summarized using graph or automata notation in Fig 1.\n\n![Growth and cell division representation using automata notation.](hsys.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"368\"}\n\nCell size $s$ at a given experimental time $t$ can be written as the combination of sizes in individual cell cycles, that is, $$\\begin{aligned}\n    s(t)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} s_n(t) P_n(t),\n\\end{aligned}$$ where $$\\begin{aligned}\n    s_n(t)=&s_{0}\\left[\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{e^{\\alpha\\left(t_{i}-t_{i-1}\\right)}}{2}\\right] e^{\\alpha\\left(t-t_{n}\\right)}\\\\\n    =&\\frac{s_0}{2^n} e^{\\alpha t}\n\\end{aligned}$$ is the cell size $s$ at experimental time $t$ given cell performed $n$ divisions. The sequence of experimental times at which division happens is $t_i$ with $t_i-t_{i-1}=\\bar{\\tau}$. The cell cycle time after $n$ divisions is given by $\\tau=t-t_n$. $$P_n(t)=\\begin{cases}\n    1,  \\text{ if }\\quad n\\,\\bar{\\tau} < t \\leq (n+1)\\bar{\\tau}  \\\\\n    0,  \\text{ otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$ dictates the number of cell cycles $n$ performed by the cell at time $t$. Cell size $s(t)$ is a periodic function in time, with a period $\\bar{\\tau}$ and a repeating dynamics represented by exponential growth $s_0e^{\\alpha t}$ in the cell cycle interval $\\tau \\in [0,\\bar{\\tau}]$.\n\n## Division mechanisms: the timer, the sizer, and the adder\n\nWe also can track key features of the cell cycle such as division time $\\tau_d$, newborn $s_b$, division $s_d$, and added size $s_a$. The feature $s_c$ records the newborn cell size of the next division event. Let $$\\mathbf{x}=[s_d,s_a,s_b,s_c,\\tau_d, s, n, \\tau]$$ be the vector of cell cycle features. At the beginning of the experiment $s_b(0)=s_c(0)=s_0$, $s_a(0)=\\tau_d(0)=0$. At the end of the first cell cycle, the size at division resets to the current cell size $s_d \\mapsto s$, then we compute the added cell size $s_a\\mapsto s-s_b$, the newborn cell size becomes half the division size $s_b \\mapsto s/2,$ the number of cell cycles performed resets to $n\\mapsto n+1,$ and the cell cycle time resets to zero $\\tau \\mapsto 0.$\n\nIt is important to maintain the order in the resets performed. Preserving this order of updating features ensures that once a cell cycle ends, $s_c$ records the newborn size of the next cell cycle event. The updated vector of features is $$\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=[s,s-s_b,s_c,s/2,\\tau,s/2,n+1,0].$$ The modified graph summarizing the cell division dynamics is shown in Fig 2.\n\n![Growth and cell division representation using automata notation.](shsm.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"368\"}\n\nThe relationships between $s_b$, $s_d$, $s_a$, and $\\tau_d$ describe the division control mechanism \\cite{}. For any cell cycle, assuming that the cell cycle time $\\tau_d[n]=\\bar{\\tau}$ is kept fixed over generations using the division rate $p(\\tau)=\\delta(\\tau-\\bar{\\tau})$, we have $s_d=s_b e^{\\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}$ and $s_a=s_d-s_b=s_b (e^{\\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}-1)$. This is known as the **timer** strategy for cell division. For any cell cycle $n$ we see that the size of the newborn cell $s_b[n]$ is affected by the size of the newborn cell in the previous generation, i.e., $$s_b[n]=\\frac{e^{\\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}}{2}s_b[n-1]$$. This recursion can be rewritten as a function of the number of cell cycles $n$ $$s_b[n]= \\frac{e^{n \\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}}{2^{n}} s_0.$$ Division size at any cell cycle is given by $$s_d[n]= \\frac{e^{(n+1) \\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}}{2^{n}} s_0.$$ Added size series are $$s_a[n]= (e^{\\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}-1)\\frac{e^{n \\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}}{2^{n}} s_0.$$ These series converges to a non-zero finite value only when $\\tau_d=\\bar{\\tau}=\\log{2}/\\alpha.$ This reduces the size at division to $s_d=2 s_b$, and the added size in any cycle to $s_a=s_b$. This implies that for any timer strategy, we will find a slope of 2 when we plot the size at division $s_d$ vs. newborn size $s_b$. Plotting added vs. newborn size gives a slope of one.\n\nIf we assume the cell divides by the division rate $p(s)=\\delta(s-\\bar{s})$, for any cell cycle $n>1$ then we have $$s_d[n]=\\bar{s},\\, s_b[n]=\\bar{s}/2,\\, \\text{and } \\, \\tau_d[n]=\\log{2}/\\alpha.$$ Such division strategy is known as **sizer**.\n\nAn alternative to this division mechanism is considering that the cell aims to add a fixed amount of size at any cell cycle. Let the division rate be $p(s)=\\delta(s-s_b-\\Delta)$, then the size at birth at any cell cycle $n$ is $$\\begin{aligned}\n    s_b[n]=&\\frac{s_b[n-1]+\\Delta}{2}\\\\\n    =&\\frac{s_0+(2^n-1)\\Delta}{2^n}\n\\end{aligned}$$ where $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}s_b[n]=\\Delta.$$ Such division strategy is know as **adder**. Size at division for the $n$ cell cycle is given by $$\ns_d[n]=2^{-n}(s_0 -\\Delta)+2 \\Delta, \\, \\lim_{n\\to \\infty}s_d[n]=2 \\Delta.\n$$\n\nDivision time at any cell cycle is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\tau_d[n]=&\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\log \\frac{s_d[n]}{s_b[n]}\\\\\n    =&\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\log\\left({2+\\frac{\\Delta-s_0}{s_0+(2^n-1)\\Delta}}\\right), \n\\end{aligned}$$ where $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\tau_d[n]=\\frac{\\log 2}{\\alpha}.$$ All division strategies can be summarize when assuming a division rate $\\delta(s-b\\,s_b-a)$. Size at birth in any cell cycle is given by $$\ns_b[n]=\\frac{b^n(a+(b-2)s_0)-2^n\\,a}{2^n(b-2)}.\n$$ Note the special cases $b=1$, $a=\\Delta$ as adder and $b=0$ as sizer. The size at division is given by $$\ns_d[n]=a+\\frac{b^{n+1}(a+(b-2)s_0)-2^nba}{2^n(b-2)}.\n$$ Cell cycle time is given by $$\n\\tau[n]=\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\log \\left[b-\\frac{2^n a(b-2)}{2^n a-b^n(a+(b-2) s_0)}\\right].\n$$\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"intro.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"intro.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
