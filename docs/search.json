Also, let the cell cycle time \\(\\tau\\) be the time it takes for a cell to grow and divide. The cell cycle progress is represented by the equation \\[\\frac{d\\tau}{dt}=1, \\, \\tau(0)=0.\\]\nA division event occurs when a cell splits into two daughter cells. This event resets both the cell size to half and the cell cycle time to zero, that is, \\[ s \\mapsto s / 2, \\quad \\tau \\mapsto 0,\\] marking the end of one cycle and the start of a new one. Let \\(P(\\tau)\\) define when division happens as per \\[P(\\tau)=U(\\tau-\\bar{\\tau})=\\begin{cases}\n    1,  \\text{ if } \\tau > \\bar{\\tau} \\\\\n    0,  \\text{ otherwise,}\n\\end{cases}\\] where \\(U(\\tau-\\bar{\\tau})\\) is the unit step function and \\(\\bar{\\tau}\\) is the time to division since the start of the cell cycle. Cell performs a division event if \\(P(\\tau)=1\\).\nThe division rate can be defined as \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    p(\\tau)&=\\frac{d P}{d\\tau}\\\\\n    &=\\delta(\\tau-\\bar{\\tau}),\n\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\delta(\\tau)\\) is the Delta Dirac function. The above description is summarized using graph or automata notation in Fig 1.\n\n\n\nGrowth and cell division representation using automata notation.\n\n\nCell size \\(s\\) at a given experimental time \\(t\\) can be written as the combination of sizes in individual cell cycles, that is, \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    s(t)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} s_n(t) P_n(t),\n\\end{aligned}\\] where \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    s_n(t)=&s_{0}\\left[\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{e^{\\alpha\\left(t_{i}-t_{i-1}\\right)}}{2}\\right] e^{\\alpha\\left(t-t_{n}\\right)}\\\\\n    =&\\frac{s_0}{2^n} e^{\\alpha t}\n\\end{aligned}\\] is the cell size \\(s\\) at experimental time \\(t\\) given cell performed \\(n\\) divisions. The sequence of experimental times at which division happens is \\(t_i\\) with \\(t_i-t_{i-1}=\\bar{\\tau}\\). The cell cycle time after \\(n\\) divisions is given by \\(\\tau=t-t_n\\). \\[P_n(t)=\\begin{cases}\n    1,  \\text{ if }\\quad n\\,\\bar{\\tau} < t \\leq (n+1)\\bar{\\tau}  \\\\\n    0,  \\text{ otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\] dictates the number of cell cycles \\(n\\) performed by the cell at time \\(t\\). Cell size \\(s(t)\\) is a periodic function in time, with a period \\(\\bar{\\tau}\\) and a repeating dynamics represented by exponential growth \\(s_0e^{\\alpha t}\\) in the cell cycle interval \\(\\tau \\in [0,\\bar{\\tau}]\\)."

    "text": "2.2 Division mechanisms: the timer, the sizer, and the adder\nWe also can track key features of the cell cycle such as division time \\(\\tau_d\\), newborn \\(s_b\\), division \\(s_d\\), and added size \\(s_a\\). The feature \\(s_c\\) records the newborn cell size of the next division event. Let \\[\\mathbf{x}=[s_d,s_a,s_b,s_c,\\tau_d, s, n, \\tau]\\] be the vector of cell cycle features. At the beginning of the experiment \\(s_b(0)=s_c(0)=s_0\\), \\(s_a(0)=\\tau_d(0)=0\\). At the end of the first cell cycle, the size at division resets to the current cell size \\(s_d \\mapsto s\\), then we compute the added cell size \\(s_a\\mapsto s-s_b\\), the newborn cell size becomes half the division size \\(s_b \\mapsto s/2,\\) the number of cell cycles performed resets to \\(n\\mapsto n+1,\\) and the cell cycle time resets to zero \\(\\tau \\mapsto 0.\\)\nIt is important to maintain the order in the resets performed. Preserving this order of updating features ensures that once a cell cycle ends, \\(s_c\\) records the newborn size of the next cell cycle event. The updated vector of features is \\[\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=[s,s-s_b,s_c,s/2,\\tau,s/2,n+1,0].\\] The modified graph summarizing the cell division dynamics is shown in Fig 2.\n\n\n\nGrowth and cell division representation using automata notation.\n\n\nThe relationships between \\(s_b\\), \\(s_d\\), \\(s_a\\), and \\(\\tau_d\\) describe the division control mechanism . For any cell cycle, assuming that the cell cycle time \\(\\tau_d[n]=\\bar{\\tau}\\) is kept fixed over generations using the division rate \\(p(\\tau)=\\delta(\\tau-\\bar{\\tau})\\), we have \\(s_d=s_b e^{\\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}\\) and \\(s_a=s_d-s_b=s_b (e^{\\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}-1)\\). This is known as the timer strategy for cell division. For any cell cycle \\(n\\) we see that the size of the newborn cell \\(s_b[n]\\) is affected by the size of the newborn cell in the previous generation, i.e., \\[s_b[n]=\\frac{e^{\\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}}{2}s_b[n-1]\\]. This recursion can be rewritten as a function of the number of cell cycles \\(n\\) \\[s_b[n]= \\frac{e^{n \\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}}{2^{n}} s_0.\\] Division size at any cell cycle is given by \\[s_d[n]= \\frac{e^{(n+1) \\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}}{2^{n}} s_0.\\] Added size series are \\[s_a[n]= (e^{\\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}-1)\\frac{e^{n \\alpha \\bar{\\tau}}}{2^{n}} s_0.\\] These series converges to a non-zero finite value only when \\(\\tau_d=\\bar{\\tau}=\\log{2}/\\alpha.\\) This reduces the size at division to \\(s_d=2 s_b\\), and the added size in any cycle to \\(s_a=s_b\\). This implies that for any timer strategy, we will find a slope of 2 when we plot the size at division \\(s_d\\) vs. newborn size \\(s_b\\). Plotting added vs. newborn size gives a slope of one.\nIf we assume the cell divides by the division rate \\(p(s)=\\delta(s-\\bar{s})\\), for any cell cycle \\(n>1\\) then we have \\[s_d[n]=\\bar{s},\\, s_b[n]=\\bar{s}/2,\\, \\text{and } \\, \\tau_d[n]=\\log{2}/\\alpha.\\] Such division strategy is known as sizer.\nAn alternative to this division mechanism is considering that the cell aims to add a fixed amount of size at any cell cycle. Let the division rate be \\(p(s)=\\delta(s-s_b-\\Delta)\\), then the size at birth at any cell cycle \\(n\\) is \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    s_b[n]=&\\frac{s_b[n-1]+\\Delta}{2}\\\\\n    =&\\frac{s_0+(2^n-1)\\Delta}{2^n}\n\\end{aligned}\\] where \\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}s_b[n]=\\Delta.\\] Such division strategy is know as adder. Size at division for the \\(n\\) cell cycle is given by \\[\ns_d[n]=2^{-n}(s_0 -\\Delta)+2 \\Delta, \\, \\lim_{n\\to \\infty}s_d[n]=2 \\Delta.\n\\]\nDivision time at any cell cycle is given by \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    \\tau_d[n]=&\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\log \\frac{s_d[n]}{s_b[n]}\\\\\n    =&\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\log\\left({2+\\frac{\\Delta-s_0}{s_0+(2^n-1)\\Delta}}\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\\] where \\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\tau_d[n]=\\frac{\\log 2}{\\alpha}.\\] All division strategies can be summarize when assuming a division rate \\(\\delta(s-b\\,s_b-a)\\). Size at birth in any cell cycle is given by \\[\ns_b[n]=\\frac{b^n(a+(b-2)s_0)-2^n\\,a}{2^n(b-2)}.\n\\] Note the special cases \\(b=1\\), \\(a=\\Delta\\) as adder and \\(b=0\\) as sizer. The size at division is given by \\[\ns_d[n]=a+\\frac{b^{n+1}(a+(b-2)s_0)-2^nba}{2^n(b-2)}.\n\\] Cell cycle time is given by \\[\n\\tau[n]=\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\log \\left[b-\\frac{2^n a(b-2)}{2^n a-b^n(a+(b-2) s_0)}\\right].\n\\]"
